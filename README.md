###React SPA for finding energy and macronutrient requirements with a focus on respiratory quotient. 

* Estimate energy needs based on weight, body fat percentage
  * Include US Navy Body Fat calculator to estimate body fat percentage
* Adjust those needs based on adaptive thermogenesis
* Have a weekly view for planning weight loss/gain with undulating intake
  * Calculate weekly average respiratory quotient
* Weekly view allows a user to mark days as fasting days (0 caloric intake)

Respiratory Quotient (RQ) is a measure of the difference between oxygen inhaled and carbon dioxide exhaled. RQ is highly influenced by diet, both in terms of energy balance and macronutrient composition. This metric allows users to more accurately gauge their caloric needs.
